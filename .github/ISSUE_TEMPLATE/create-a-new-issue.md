Before creating a new issue please check if your config is correct (e.g. by checking the [Wiki](https://github.com/teeminus/NoTouchScreenFirmware/wiki)). Please also check already created and/or closed issues which might be relevant.

When nothing of the above helps please add both the 3D printer mainboard name and the display type to the issue title. The body of the issue should contain the affected firmware version of this firmware as well as the configuration for the display and the revision of the mainboard control software - if applicable.
